	<name>Density Updater</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Updates a density model.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Updates a density model.
			Note that the model can only be updated with
			the data it was initialized with in the corresponding initializer
			node (
			<b>Potential Density Initializer</b>
			or
			<b>Graph Density Initializer</b>
			).
			The update is performed by reducing the densities in the
			neighborhoods of all newly labeled data points according to the used
			density estimation algorithm.
		</intro>
		<option name="Unknown Row Handling">Depending on this setting, the node either ignores
			unknown rows (i.e. rows that were not used for the model creation) or
			fails if it encounters one.</option>
	</fullDescription>

	<ports>
		<inPort name="Density Scorer Model" index="0">
			Density scorer model created with either the
			<b>Potential Density Initializer</b>
			or the
			<b>Graph Density Initializer</b>
			node.
		</inPort>
		<inPort name="Update Data" index="1" optional="true">
			Table containing rows whose density in the model needs to be reduced prior
			to scoring the first input table.
			In an active learning setting these would be the rows that were freshly
			labeled by the user.
			The update is omitted if this port is not connected.
		</inPort>
		<outPort name="Updated Density Scorer Model" index="0">The updated
			model i.e. decreased densities in the neighborhood of
			rows in the
			second input table.
