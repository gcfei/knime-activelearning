	<name>Entropy Uncertainty Scorer</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Calculates the entropy uncertainty score of a class probability distribution.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Calculates the entropy uncertainty score of a class probability
			distribution. Input are rows containing class probabilities P = p1,
			p2, ..., pn that must sum up to 1.
			Output will be the normalized
			<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Shannon_entropy">Shannon entropy</a>
			. This is defined by E(P) = H(P) / log(n) with
			H(P) = -
			sum(p_i*log(p_i) for each i in 1,...,n. The logarithm with base 2 is
			used. The
			normalization leads always to values between 0 and 1. A
			uniform
			probability distribution (i.e., most uncertain as all
			probabilities
			are equal to each other) has an entropy value
			of 1. If
			one of the
			class probabilities is 1 and the others 0, the highest
			certainty is given and the
			entropy value will be 0.
		</intro>
		<option name="Column Selection">
			Include the columns containing the class
			probabilities. The values must sum up to 1 for each data row.
		</option>
		<option name="Output column name">
			Set the name of the appended output column.
		</option>
		<option name="In case of invalid input...">
			Specify the action if a data row of the input is invalid.
			Invalid
			could mean a missing value in
			the input or
			an
			invalid distribution
			(the
			probabilities
			must sum up to 1). If
			<i>fail</i>
			is
			selected,
			the node will fail.
			Otherwise, the node just gives a
			warning
			and puts
			missing values in
			the output for the corresponding
			rows.
