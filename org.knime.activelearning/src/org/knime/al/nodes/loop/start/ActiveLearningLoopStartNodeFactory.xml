        <intro> 
           <p>
               The Active Learning Loop is an extension to the regular Recursive Loop with an additional model port. It enables
               passing of a data table and an arbitrary model from the Active Learning Loop End back to the Active Learning Loop Start.
           </p>
           <p>
               The Loop Start requires an initialized table and model, which will be output by the Active Learning Loop Start in 
               the first iteration of the loop.
           </p>
           <p>
               The table and model received by the corresponding Active Learning Loop End is passed back to the Active Learning Loop Start node.
               Starting with the second iteration, the Active Learning Loop Start node outputs the table and model as received by the 
               Active Learning Loop End.
